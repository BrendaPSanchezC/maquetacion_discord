                <br>
                <p>Discord was started to solve a big problem: how to communicate with friends
                    around the world while playing games online. Since childhood, founders Jason
                    Citron and Stan Vishnevskiy both shared a love of video games, cherishing the
                    friendships and connections that formed while playing them. At the time, all
                    the tools built for this job were slow, unreliable, and complex. Jason and Stan
                    knew they could make a better service that encouraged talking, helped form
                    memories, and recreated the feeling of togetherness all found through
                    gaming.</p>

                <h2 class="titulo">Chapter One</h2>
                <br>
                <p>So, in 2015, Stan and Jason started to bring Discord to life. People from all over
                    the world loved it. Discord made it easy to genuinely communicate with friends,
                    going beyond casual talking. Friends were staying in touch with their various
                    communities. Discord was making it easy to participate in conversation, hopping
                    around text, voice and video to talk. The technology was complex but the goal
                    was simple: make Discord an inviting and comfortable home to jump into with
                    your communities and friends. Within a few years, Discord began to take off, and
                    devoted people who loved our product sprung up around the world.</p>
